Kicad exports the circuit design in SVG format, so it will be necessary to convert the SVG to G-Code, as this is the format accepted by the laser CNC. 
This can be done using a small piece of software developed by me, and made in Java, to perform this conversion. 
SvgToGcode.jar is an executable that serves to carry out this conversion.
